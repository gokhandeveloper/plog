###Gokhan Dilek

Hello there!
My name is Gokhan Dilek & have been developing apps since I was a teenager.
I have always been interested in tech & tinkering.
Here you will find my mumblings as well as archived blogs.

It is good to push your boundaries and learn new languages.
I was going to build this blog using WordPress however, I have forked the site from Uncle bob built using Clojure.
I love it so far!
