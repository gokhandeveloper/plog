###Gokhan Dilek

Hello there!
My name is Gokhan Dilek & have been in the tech industry for one and a half decade.
I have always been interested in tech & tinkering.
Here you will find my blogs and interesting projects I am currently working on.

I was going to build this blog using WordPress however, I have forked the site from Uncle bob built using Clojure.
I love it so far!
